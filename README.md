# Multiple Object detection and classification for a Self Driving Car in an urban environment

- ## Project overview: 
This section should contain a brief description of the project and what we are trying to achieve. Why is object detection such an important component of self-driving car systems?

##Set up: 
This section should contain a brief description of the steps to follow to run the code for this repository.

##Dataset:

###Dataset Analysis: 
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts, and other visualizations.

##Training:

##Reference experiment: 
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should include training metrics, Tensorboard charts, and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performance.

##Improve on the reference: 
This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
