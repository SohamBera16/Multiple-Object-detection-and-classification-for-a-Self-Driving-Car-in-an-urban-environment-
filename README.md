# Multiple Object detection and classification for a Self Driving Car in an urban environment

- ## Project overview: 
The goal of this project is to create a convolutional neural network based model to detect and classify objects using data from the Waymo dataset.  By using a dataset of images of urban environments containing annotated cyclists, pedestrians and vehicles, the goal is to detect them in real-life test images and correctly classify them into one of the three categories.

- ## Set up: 
This section should contain a brief description of the steps to follow to run the code for this repository.

- ## Dataset:

- ### Dataset Analysis: 
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts, and other visualizations.

- ## Training:

- ## Reference experiment: 
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should include training metrics, Tensorboard charts, and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performance.

- ## Improve on the reference: 
This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
